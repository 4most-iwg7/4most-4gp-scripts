# NB: The shebang line above assumes you've installed a python virtual environment alongside your working copy of the
# <4most-4gp-scripts> git repository. It also only works if you invoke this python script from the directory where it
# is located. If these two assumptions are incorrect (e.g. you're using Conda), you can still use this script by typing
# <python plot_everything.py>, but <./plot_everything.py> will not work.

"""
This script looks in the directory <4most-4gp-scripts/output_data/cannon> to see what tests you've run through the
Cannon and plots up the results automatically.

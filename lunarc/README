The scripts in this directory are used for running Turbospectrum on the LUNARC
aurora cluster, using the slurm job submission system.

To use this, simply run:

sbatch demo_stars_submit.sh
sbatch marcs_submit.sh
sbatch ahm2017_submit.sh
sbatch ges_dwarfs_submit.sh

These typically use a total of 80 cores (4 nodes x 20 cores per node) on
Aurora.

Each core synthesises its spectra into a separate spectrum library, because
sqlite3 tends to break if it has 80 cores attempting to access the same
database. Consequently, the output from the 80 cores needs to be merged into a
single spectrum library at the end. This is done with the script <merge.py>:

python merge_libraries.py --input-library demo_stars
python merge_libraries.py --input-library turbospec_ahm2017_perturbed
python merge_libraries.py --input-library turbospec_marcs_grid
python merge_libraries.py --input-library turbospec_ges_dwarfs_perturbed

I typically also move all of the output logs that slurm generates into my log
directory:

mv worker_200058_* stdout_marcs_farm_200058.out stderr_marcs_farm_200058.out ../output_data/logs/marcs_stars_0/
